‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± The druid

The Druid worships Hircine, the Beast spirit, or is a mage attuned to nature. They can grow trees and brambles and summon the beasts of nature.

Taking a unique approach to summoning in the form of concentration based minions, the Druid avoids direct combat, shaping nature to create damaging or blocking overgrowth. Their minions often have persistent effects, encouraging the Druid to swap between them in battle.

For those looking to intervene more directly, Force of Nature allows the Druid to transform into a Horned Lord, a powerful melee fighter that steals Magicka with its power attacks. Direct damage comes from bleed/poison spells that grow Goodberries in the inventory of their victims, which can be eaten for a powerful heal.

ü¢í Conjuration

(Novice) Call Raven: Concentrate to summon a Raven. It blinds living targets, reducing weapon skills by 40 points.
(Apprentice) Call Rattlesnakes: Concentrate to summon 2 Rattlesnakes. Their attacks deal 2 poison damage per second.
(Adept) Call Gray Wolf: Concentrate to summon a Gray Wolf. Its attacks cause living targets below 20% Health to rapidly bleed out.
(Expert) Call Snow Leopard: Concentrate to summon a Snow Leopard. Its attacks drain 40 points of Stamina and it moves faster in combat.
(Master) Call Hound of Hircine: Concentrate to summon a Hound of Hircine. Its attacks reduce armor by 250 points for 10 seconds.

Dual casting summons two, and so does Twin Souls, for a total of 4 minions (8 in case of Rattlesnakes) that are also instantly resummoned on death. However, there's a non-negotiable summon cost that will drain your mana even if your casting cost is reduced to zero by enchantments. Dual casting gets you the same minions as casting with both hands, but dual casting in this case is not more expensive than casting with both hands but cheaper.

‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± The shadow mage

Shadow magic is a rare and powerful form of magic in the Elder Scrolls universe. It is not just the absence of light, but manipulation of probabilities.

Shadow mages are very mobile, having access to various forms of teleportation, but their offensive spells are short ranged or even melee attack based. Their ability to turn a percentage of their Magicka into burst damage makes them excellent at striking first, striking hard, and disappearing, but if they do end up in a prolonged fight, they can leech back their Magicka in several ways. They become more effective in darkness, both natural and supernatural.

Instead of light, their spells emit pools of shadow.

‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± The warlock

The Warlock is a Daedra summoner at best, Daedra worshipper at worst. They have strong interactions between their vile damage spells and summonings.

Warlocks bind the Spirits of those who die under the effects of their raw damage Destruction spells. Afterwards, summoning a Warlock minion within 30 seconds consumes the Spirit to increase its Health, Damage, and add a bonus effect. For instance, the Magister uses a staff and drains mana from its victims, building towards a devastating area effect attack; if a Spirit is offered, it will also generate Magicka on its own.

The synergy works both ways, as poison spells amplify the damage Warlock minions deal to the target and reduce the damage the target deals to them.

(Novice) Eldritch Blast: Warping blast that deals 20 raw damage. If the target dies, bind their Spirit for 30 seconds.

(Expert) Cloudkill: Corrupting blast deals 50 magic damage and leaves a 20 poison damage cloud. Targets in the cloud are 30% weaker to warlock minions.
(Master) Hurl Into Oblivion: Deals 60 raw damage and flings survivors into Oblivion until the spell is cast again. If a target dies, bind their Spirit for 30 seconds.

‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± The cleric

The Cleric is a healer, paladin or inquisitor. They can cast holy fire, channel auras to strengthen their allies and themselves, or turn enemies into allies.

Clerics can either support their allies in various ways or enter the fray themselves. For those looking to spread the word of their deity by fire and sword, the Cleric has several weapon buffs, Destruction spells that combine fire and sun damage to harm most enemies and the undead doubly so, and can cast auras, which are concentration based buffs that benefit both the Cleric and their party members and release an additional effect when the Cleric stops concentrating on them. If things get too rough, the Cleric can temporarily remove their enemies from the battlefield.

If the Cleric finds themselves without allies, they can force Obedience upon their enemies, converting them for a short time and even allowing the Cleric to trade with them. A more permanent minion is the Spirit Guardian, a summoned follower that can be equipped with gear and returns it when it eventually dies.

‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± The shaman

The Shaman worships the All-Maker, the Earth Bones, or the Old Ways. Their spells revolve around spirits, visions, totems and Oneness with the Land.

Shamans are about intel and manipulation of both enemies and the terrain. They can see enemy weaknesses in the form of mystical visions, and unleash the spirits of the land to drain their attributes and Health with ghostly flames. Their totems have limited range, but they can also send forth controllable animal spirits to fight or scout the battlefield from above while the caster remains at a safe distance. Visually, most of their spells have a pale spectral glow to them.

For those wanting to play a more direct Shaman, there is support for a melee build centred on reducing enemy armor.
