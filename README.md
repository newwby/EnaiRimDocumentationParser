# EnaiRimDocumentationParser
Bespoke text formatter for ModNexus (alternative to webscraper) to get tabulated raw text output for a google sheets project

Mod Nexus authors have often messy and non-cohesive descriptions. I need the information on specific pages as raw text organised in a specific way.

Started down the route of writing a text parser rather than a webscraper as I already had the raw text dumps I needed from the website.

Will eventually be converted into a google sheets project for the EnaiRim community to use to build Skyrim characters with the EnaiSiaion framework.
